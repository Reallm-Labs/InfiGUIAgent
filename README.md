This is the repo for the paper "[InfiGUIAgent: A Multimodal Generalist GUI Agent with Native Reasoning and Reflection](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.04575)". In this work, we develop a multimodal large language model-based GUI agent that enables enhanced task automation on computing devices. Our agent is trained through a two-stage supervised fine-tuning approach that focuses on fundamental GUI understanding skills and advanced reasoning capabilities, where we integrate hierarchical reasoning and expectation-reflection reasoning to enable native reasoning abilities in GUI interactions.

We are in the process of uploading key artifacts from our paper to our 🤗 [Hugging Face Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/Reallm-Labs/infiguiagent-67a4e4bdfbba9036a1700d97).

Regarding the full model release, due to licensing restrictions on portions of our training data from third-party sources, we are currently sanitizing the dataset and retraining/refining the final model to ensure full compliance while maintaining performance.

Stay tuned for updates! 🔜
